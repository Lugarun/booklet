title: Recurent Neural Networks
---
This is all acording to [nielsen2019neural](../Resources/nielsen2019neural.pdf):

Neurons fire for some limited duration of time.
This firing stiumlates other neurons which fire a littlw 
while later, also fora a limited time. This causes a cascade
effect and so loops aren't a problem because a neurons 
output only affects its input at a later time.

These networks have been less influential than feedforward
networks because the learning algorithms are less powerful.
