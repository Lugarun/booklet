I am just starting my research jouney and I think that I will do my best work
if I am having fun and love the tools that I am using.

So, to organize my research and thoughts I created a personal wiki!

I want two main things out of my wiki:

1. good plaintext readability
2. editor wiki navigation
3. good support for markdown, latex, orgmode, and good litterate programming features

### My Wiki Setup
Currenty this is a work in progress as I am only a month into my Graduate studies.

I have my favourite [editor](./Editor.md) to just be functional.
It will follow markdown links, opening pdfs in zathura
automatically and opening other markdown files.

For the actual wiki here is my directory layout:

```
.
├── content
│   ├── papers
│   └── wiki
├── src
└── style
    ├── css
    └── templates

```



### Remaining Wiki Wants

- Make the wiki more beatifull, take inspiration from the famous [Japorized notes](https://tex.japorized.ink/)
- Bibliography maybe checkout [this](https://peter.colberg.org/site)
- Split private and public posts so that I can push this to github
- browser wiki search function
- import school classes
- import finances
- import dnd
