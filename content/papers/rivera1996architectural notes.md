# An Architectural Description of the Simplex Architecture
## Overview
Goal: create a formal specification of simplex architecture to analyze it's
 safety and liveness properties.
Method:
1. create a CSP model of simplex
2. verify the CSP model using FDR model checker
3. develope WRIGHT specification 

## Concepts

Communicating Sequential Processes:
- a formal language for describing interaction in concurrent systems

Basically they review designs of systems using abstract logic.


## Notes

Applied simplex to motion control(simplex is an architecture for live software updates) 

There is a safety controller, an advanced controller, an updater.
